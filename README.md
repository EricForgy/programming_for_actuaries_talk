# programming_for_actuaries_talk
How adopting programming techniques can help actuaries 

This repository contains (or will do) notes and the presentation (reveal.js)

Presentation uses [Reveal.js](https://revealjs.com) and the extremely helpful rmarkdown rendering in [RStudio](https://github.com/rstudio/revealjs).

To build the presentation:
* Start RStudio
* Open presentation.rmd and hit the knitr button at the top of the text editor section
* or open render_presentation.r and source the code
* after about a minute presentation.html will be rendered
* open in the browser (or it may open in a new RStudio window automatically)
